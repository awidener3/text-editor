# text-editor
This is a homework assignment from the UCF Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I am tasked with creating a text editor that functions on a single page, follows PWA criteria, and works offline. The application is also able to be downloaded onto your computer or mobile device to be used outside of the browser.
